# Odoo API Module User Guide

Welcome to the Odoo API Module User Guide. This guide will help you understand how to use the API module to interact with your Odoo 16 CE instance. The API module allows you to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on Odoo data through a secure and easy-to-use interface.

## Getting Started

Before you can start using the API module, you need to install it in your Odoo instance. Follow the installation instructions provided in the `__manifest__.py` file to get started.

## Generating an API Key

To use the API, you must first generate an API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the Odoo server.

1. Navigate to the API Keys menu item, which can be found under the settings/configuration tab.
2. Click on the "Create" button to generate a new API key.
3. Once the key is generated, make sure to copy and save it securely. You will need this key to make API requests.

## Defining API Endpoints

With the API module, you can define custom endpoints to interact with specific Odoo models.

1. Go to the API Endpoints menu item.
2. Click on "Create" to define a new endpoint.
3. Specify the name of the Odoo model you want to interact with.
4. Choose the operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that you want to enable for this endpoint.
5. Save your new endpoint.

## Performing CRUD Operations

### Create

To add a new record to an Odoo model:

1. Send a POST request to the endpoint URL with the API key and the data you want to create.
2. The server will respond with the details of the newly created record.

### Read

To retrieve data from Odoo:

1. Send a GET request to the endpoint URL with the API key.
2. Optionally, you can include filters and search parameters in your request.
3. The server will respond with the requested data.

### Update

To modify an existing record:

1. Send a PUT request to the endpoint URL with the API key and the updated data.
2. The server will respond with the details of the updated record.

### Delete

To remove a record from Odoo:

1. Send a DELETE request to the endpoint URL with the API key and the ID of the record you want to delete.
2. The server will confirm the deletion of the record.

## Security and Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using the API key generated earlier. Include your API key in the header of each request to ensure secure access.

## Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse, the API module includes options to set limits on API usage. You can configure these settings in the API Access Rules menu item.

## Data Encryption

The API module ensures that all data in transit is encrypted. Make sure to use HTTPS to take advantage of this security feature.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about using the API module, please refer to the `developer_guide.md` for technical details or contact our support team.

Thank you for using the Odoo API module. We hope this guide helps you integrate Odoo with your external applications seamlessly.
