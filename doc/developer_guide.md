# Odoo 16 CE API Module Developer Guide

Welcome to the Developer Guide for the Odoo 16 CE API Module. This guide is intended for developers who wish to understand the technical aspects of the API module and how to extend or customize its functionality.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have a working development environment with Odoo 16 CE installed. Familiarize yourself with Odoo's module structure and the Python programming language.

## Module Structure

The API module consists of several components that work together to provide API functionality. Here's a brief overview of the key files and their roles:

- `__init__.py`: Initializes the module and imports the models and controllers.
- `__manifest__.py`: Contains metadata about the module, including dependencies, data files, and web assets.
- `models/`: Contains the model definitions for `ApiKey`, `ApiAccessRule`, and `ApiEndpoint`.
- `security/`: Includes CSV and XML files for access control and security groups.
- `views/`: Holds the XML files defining the UI views for managing API keys, access rules, and endpoints.
- `controllers/`: Contains the `api_controller.py` file, which defines the CRUD operation methods.
- `data/`: Includes XML files for initializing module data.
- `static/`: Contains static files such as JavaScript, CSS, and XML templates for the module's web interface.
- `doc/`: Documentation files, including this developer guide.

## Models

The module defines three main models:

- `ApiKey`: Represents API keys and includes methods for key generation and validation.
- `ApiAccessRule`: Defines access rules for API endpoints.
- `ApiEndpoint`: Represents API endpoints and includes methods for CRUD operations.

Refer to the model files in the `models/` directory for detailed field definitions and methods.

## Controllers

The `api_controller.py` file in the `controllers/` directory defines the methods for handling API requests. These methods use the `@http.route` decorator to map HTTP routes to Odoo actions.

## Security

Access control is managed through the `ir.model.access.csv` and `api_security.xml` files in the `security/` directory. Define new security groups and access rights as needed.

## Views

The module's UI is defined in the XML files within the `views/` directory. These files define form and tree views for managing API keys, access rules, and endpoints.

## Web Assets

JavaScript, CSS, and XML template files are located in the `static/src/` directory. These files are responsible for the client-side behavior and styling of the module's interface.

## Extending the Module

To extend the module:

1. Create new models or extend existing ones by adding fields or methods.
2. Add or modify controllers to handle additional API routes.
3. Update views to reflect changes in the models or to add new UI elements.
4. Extend or override web assets to alter the module's behavior or appearance.

## Customization

For advanced customization, you can:

- Create new security groups for finer-grained access control.
- Add new data files for pre-populating the module with custom records.
- Develop custom JavaScript components for enhanced client-side interactions.

## Testing

Ensure that all new features and customizations are thoroughly tested. Write unit tests for models and controller methods, and perform integration testing with external applications.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a starting point for developers working with the Odoo 16 CE API Module. For further assistance, refer to the `UserGuide` and Odoo's official documentation.
